# product_landing_page
Welcome to my Product Landing Page clone GitHub repository! Here you'll find a replica of a website created using HTML and CSS.

The Product Landing Page is a website that showcases a specific product and provides users with information about the product, its features, and how to purchase it. My clone of the website includes all of the same features and layout as the original, and was created using HTML and CSS.

By exploring this repository, you can learn about the fundamentals of web development, including HTML and CSS syntax, layout design, and responsive web design principles. You can also use this clone as a starting point for creating your own product landing page.

Feel free to clone this repository and make modifications to it to suit your own needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. Happy coding!
